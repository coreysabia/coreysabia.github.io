This post marks the beginning of an attempt at writing blog posts on a consistant basis. From this day forward I am going to attempt to post atleast once a month on topics related to what I am working on + researching that month.

Keep an eye out for the first iteration this month; it will likely be focused on integrating the [speedtest command line][speedtest-cli] utility by Ookla with an [ELK Stack][elasticsearch].

[speedtest-cli]:        https://www.speedtest.net/apps/cli
[elasticsearch]:        https://www.elastic.co/
